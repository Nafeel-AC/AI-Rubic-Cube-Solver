This project was created by me to test my knowledge of genetic algorithm. I used it to solve the complex problem of a rubics cube using the power of evolutionary algorithm. The frontend was made in pygame . The cube is represented by 2D graphics. To run this project run the main.py file. It is able to solve many complex scrambles. For any issue you can contact me at nafeelmannan@gmail.com.
